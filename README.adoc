Orchestration CLI of MSO4SC Project, based on Cloudify CLI. Its goal is to provide an interface to interact with a remote MSOOrchestrator instance. For more information, visit {uri-cloudify-cli}.


== Installation

MSOOrchestrator-CLI offers a vagrant file and a docker image to easily start using the command line. Besides it can be installed following {uri-cloudify-cli-install}[the docs].

=== Docker

At {uri-docker-image}[Docker Hub] you can find the latest build image to start using the CLI.

----
# docker run -it --name cli -v <PATH>/croupier-resources:/cli/resources ari-apc-lab/croupier-cli -- bash
[root@ec71ada311d6 cli]# exit
# docker start -ai cli
[root@ec71ada311d6 cli]# exit
----

To build:
`docker build -t ari-apc-lab/croupier-cli .` 

=== Vagrant

A vagrant file is provided to create a new Virtual Vox machine with the CLI inside.

NOTE: Modify the path `"../resources/blueprint-examples"` to bind the blueprint examples repository to your virtual machine. Comment the line if you don't want to bind the examples.

== Usage

=== Local mode

Orchestration CLI of MSO4SC Project, based on Cloudify CLI, allows you to execute your blueprints without connecting to the remote MSOOrchestrator instance.

[source,shell]
----
ID=BLUEPRINT_ID
cfy blueprints validate blueprint.yaml # Validate your blueprint
cfy init --install-plugins -b $ID \
    -i ../local-blueprint-inputs.yaml blueprint.yaml # Create a new local app instance
cfy executions start -b $ID install # Bootstrap the app instance
cfy executions start -b $ID run_jobs # Execute the app instance workflow
cfy executions start -b $ID uninstall # Revert the app instance
----

=== Remote mode

To connect to a MSOOrchestrator instance, run the following command with your user credentials and remote host or IP of the orchestrator. If you don't have an orchestrator instance yet, follow <<msoorchestrator-installation>> first.

[source,shell]
----
cfy profile use [ORCHESTRATOR_IP] -t default_tenant -u [USER] -p [PASS]
cfy status
----

Once you are connected to the MSOOrchestrator, you can perform the usual Cloudify CLI workflow for install, run and uninstall your TOSCA based applications:

[source,shell]
----
ID=MY_ID
cfy blueprints upload -b $ID blueprint.yaml # Upload the blueprint
cfy deployments create -b $ID \
    -i ../local-blueprint-inputs.yaml $ID # Create the app instance
cfy executions start -d $ID install # Bootstrap the app instance
cfy executions start -d $ID run_jobs # Execute the app instance workflow
cfy executions start -d $ID uninstall # Revert the app instance
cfy deployments delete $ID # Remove the app instance
cfy blueprints delete $ID # Remove the blueprint
----

You can find several examples and real applications in the https://github.com/MSO4SC/resources[resources respository @ Github]

[msoorchestrator-installation]
== MSOOrchestrator installation

The MSO Orchestrator, based on cloudify, can be easily installed from this CLI.

.Requirements:
* Running instance of MSOOrchestrator-CLI vagrant or docker image.
* Centos 7 remote machine with at least 2 CPUs and 4 Gb of RAM (4 CPUs and 12 Gb RAM recommended), reachable by the CLI, with requiretty disabled, and no password for sudo command.
** Set `Defaults !requiretty` on sudoers file (`/etc/sudoers`)
** If user is not root, `echo '[USER] ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL' >> /etc/sudoers`
** Check if firewalld is installed, and install it if not:
----
yum install firewalld
systemctl unmask firewalld
systemctl enable firewalld
systemctl start firewalld
----

To install the orchestrator, just execute in the CLI:+
`./bootstrap-manager.sh [Centos HOST] [Centos SSH USER] [Orchestrator NEW ADMIN USER] [Orchestrator NEW ADMIN PASSWORD]`
